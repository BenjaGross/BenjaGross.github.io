I have never been interested in playing video games so I was surprised as anyone to realize that I enjoy dungeons and dragons. For my current campaign I built a Paladin named Str√¶thum that quickly became my favorite of the characters I've built so I wanted to build some sort of representation as a tribute.

Dungeons and Dragons characters progress from level to level so I decided that I would figure out a way to chart my character from level to level. However, I didn't know of a D&D character graph; enter d3.js 

d3.js is a Javascript library for building graphs and charts, check out what I was able to accomplish below.
